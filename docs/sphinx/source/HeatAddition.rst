HeatAddition
============
This section documents the ``CHeatAddition`` class encoded in the
``isentropic_models.py`` file.  This class contains models for
all generic adiabatic-isentropic process that may be relevant
to the determination of exit properties for a fluid leaving
a Heat Exchanger or a Combustion Chamber.  
This class assumes sub-sonic, incompressible gas flow.
