CompressorComponent
===================
This section documents the ``CompressorComp`` class encoded in the
``isentropic_models.py`` file.  This class contains models for
all generic adiabatic-isentropic process that may be relevant
to the determination of exit properties for a fluid leaving
a diffuser or a nozzle.  This class assumes sub-sonic, incompressible
gas flow.
